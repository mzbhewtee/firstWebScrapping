My thought process:
1. I am required to get the top 10 most popular books so i decided
to use the review as my object of popularity. The reason being that if 1 person views a book 
and gives it 5stars and 200,000 people read/view a book and the average rating is 3stars. 
So, i concluded that the popularity of a book cannot be determine by the ratings.

2.After i decided to go with the reviews then i concluded that
after the review is done then the most expensive books out of the popular books can now be chosen.

3. After these, The price will be concatenated with each book on a newline.

4. I also thought of creating a csv file out of my output but I didn't get satisfied with the result as it 
prints out list in each column, so, i removed the code.
